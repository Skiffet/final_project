The senior project evaluation process is super important! It helps make sure that student group projects are good quality, complete, and successful. 
This proposal explains the steps and rules for checking a project after it's done. 
The main goal is to give helpful feedback and decide if the project is good enough to get approved.

## Context
In our senior project system, students, teachers, and admins work together to handle senior projects. 
There are three main kinds of people: Students (Leads, Members, and regular Students), Teachers (Advisors and non-Advisors), and Admins. 
Each person has a different job, and they all work together to make the whole system run smoothly.

The process involves a lead student starting a project, making a group, finding an advisor, 
and sending in a project plan. Then, the advisor says yes, and after finishing the project, the group gives in a project report. 
But, there's a missing part: the evaluation step.
The administrative process involves a lead student initiating a project, forming a group, seeking an advisor, and submitting project proposals. Subsequently, 
the advisor approves the proposal, and upon project completion, the group submits the project report. However, a crucial step is missing: the evaluation process.

## Purpose of Evaluation
The purpose of the evaluation process is to subject the completed project to a thorough assessment by a group of faculty members. 
This assessment aims to gauge the project's completeness, code quality, documentation, and presentation. 
By incorporating this evaluation step, we ensure that projects undergo a comprehensive review, leading to informed decisions regarding their approval or rejection.

## Objectives
- Establish a systematic approach for evaluating senior projects.
- Define clear criteria for assessing project completeness, code quality, documentation, and presentation.
- Enhance transparency and objectivity in the evaluation process.

## Scope
The proposed evaluation process will be integrated into the existing senior project administrative system. 
It will involve the collaboration of students, faculty members serving as advisors, and a designated group of faculty evaluators. 
The scope covers the evaluation of project reports submitted by student groups, emphasizing the key criteria mentioned earlier.

By implementing this evaluation process, we aim to ensure that senior projects not only meet academic standards but also contribute meaningfully to 
the learning experience and professional development of the participating students.
